# where are the robots
**Points:** 100

## Category
Web Exploitation

## Task
Can you find the robots? `https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/4159/` ([link](https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/4159/)) or http://2019shell1.picoctf.com:4159

# Solution
The first hint is the name of the challenge itself. We have to check the robots file of the webpage. 'Robots' are technically the webmaster tool to crawl and index web pages. Go to `https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/4159/robots.txt` and it states to disallow the `/a44f7.html` page to be indexed. Therefore, upon entering [https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/4159/a44f7.html](https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/4159/a44f7.html), we will find the flag.

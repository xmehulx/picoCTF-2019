## Task
The factory is hiding things from all of its users. Can you login as logon and find what they've been looking at? https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/12284/ ([link](https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/12284/)) or http://2019shell1.picoctf.com:12284

# Solution
Once again we begin with viewing the page source, but we couldn't find anything useful. So the next thing we try is to set a proxy using **Burp Suite** to check the cookies when we enter the username and password as 'okay' and 'bye' respectively.


```http
GET /flag HTTP/1.1
Host: 2019shell1.picoctf.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:71.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/71.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Referer: https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/12284/
Connection: close
Cookie: password=bye; username=okay; admin=False
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
```

In this, as we can make out, the 'admin status' has been set as ```False```, and when we change it to ```True``` and forward the cookie, it will display the flag.
